LEC III
>develop a software (0:19) (SDLC)
1)Gather as much info as possible about the details and specifications of the desired software from the client (Requirement)

2)Plan and preparing the lanquage like java, php, .net and Database which will be suitable  for the project  with related function (Design)

3)actually code the software (build stage) (1:04)

4)Test the software to verify that it is built as per the specification given by the client (test) (1:122)

5)Maintenance stage for code changed due to  the enhancement requested from client (1:26)

>From 1 to  5 is a.k.a software development life cycle or Waterfall method
>Wrong product to the client could occur due to mistake in the requirement (1:50)

>V-model of testing (2:45) (SUPER important)
For each test in SDLC, there is a corresponding for each step of SDLC (2:45)
*1)Requirement Analysis>User acceptance test plan->User acceptance testing
*2)Function specification->System test plan->system testing
*3)High Level Design>Integration Test Plan->Integration test
*4) Detailed Designed/Program specification->Unit test plan>unit test
5)code

>LEFT SDLC and right is STLC

>Iterative life cycle (3:33)
Each phase has a requirement, design, build and test
-It is either called rapid application development or agile development

>Testing in a life cycle model (3:58)
-Development model selected for a project depending on the aims and goal of that project
-Testing is a stand-alone activity and it has to be adapt with the development model chosen for the project
-In any model, testing should be done in all levels

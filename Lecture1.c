LEC1
->Software testing is a process used to identify the correctness and quality of developed computer software.

->It include a set of activities conducted with the intent of finding errors in software that it could be  corrected before the product is released to the end user.

->check the software system is defect free

LEC 2
Moving file from a folder A to folder B
>Does file exist in A (Me)
>Do we have the same file in B (Me)
>What happen if the disk size is full and in a shared drive (Me)
>To test if the file is open while moving (0:29)
>security right to pass the file in Folder B

>Exhaust testing is not possible (for 2) (1:12)
>We need optimal amount of testing based on the RISK assessment of the application (1:21)
>Muti-tasking module needed to be tested thoroughly
>Defect Clustering (for 4)(2:03)
>A small number of modules contain most of the defects detected.
>With the experience, we can identify such risky modules
>However, the problem is that the same test are repeated over again. Eventually same test will no longer find new bugs (a.k.a pesticide paradox for 5) (2:18)
>To overcome this, the test case is required to be reviewed and revised. Adding new and different test cases to help find new defects. (2:28)

>Testing principle stats that->testing shows presence of defects (for 1). For instance, testing reduces the probably of undiscovered defects remaining in the software. But even if no defects are found, it is not a proof of correctness 

>Absence of error is a fallacy (for 7)
>Next step is: Early testing (for 3) (4:24)
Testing should start as early as possible in the software development life cycle so any issue is discovered in the design phase as well (4:32)

->Testing is Context dependent (for 6): Test eCommerce such as amazon is different than testing MS office (4:49)
